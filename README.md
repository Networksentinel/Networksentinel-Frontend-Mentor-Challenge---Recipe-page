## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS - modular approach, nesting, mixins
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build tool

### What I learned

Honestly, this challenge gave me a bit of a hard time! Getting the design right was tricky, especially when it came to mobile vs tablet/desktop views. I ended up reworking my HTML structure a few times to make sure it all fit.

I also realized that static assets like images and fonts should go in the `/public` folder - Vite doesn’t have to process them during build, and it avoids problems with paths after the build.

But overall, I enjoyed making the design fluid and responsive while matching the three different versions (desktop, tablet, and mobile) from the Figma file.

### Continued development

**Here’s the plan moving forward:**

- Keep focusing on semantic HTML
- Use Sass/SCSS + Vite for all my projects
- Stick to a modular approach
- Get even more comfortable with nesting and mixins, and use them regularly
- Make all of this feel like second nature
